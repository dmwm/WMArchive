## CMS WMArchive

The WMArchive is a computing project within the CMS experiment at CERN to reliably store its Workflow and Data Management framework job report (FWJR) documents.

## Documentation

Documentation is available in this project's [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/dmwm/WMArchive/wiki).

## Performance Service

The WMArchive Performance Service provides an aggregation pipeline that regularly processes the database of FWJRs to collect performance metrics. A [web app](https://cmsweb.cern.ch/wmarchive/web/performance) visualizes the aggregated data and provides flexible filters and options to assist the CMS data operators in assessing the performance of the CMS computing jobs.
